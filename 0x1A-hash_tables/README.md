## About
In this project, I learn about hash table data structure and its implementation.

## Objectives
- At the end of this project I am expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is a hash function
- What makes a good hash function
- What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
- What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
- What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## Requirements
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Interpretation/Compilation Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **New Line Requirement**: All your files should end with a new line
- **Mandatory README**: A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- **Code Style**: Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- **Global Variables**: You are not allowed to use global variables
- **Functions Per File**: No more than 5 functions per file
- **Allowed Libraries**: You are allowed to use the C standard library
- **Header File**: The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `hash_tables.h`. All your header files should be include guarded
